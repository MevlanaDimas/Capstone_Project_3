California House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

In this project I used XGBoost Regression modeling for predicting house price in California, you can look at there have 2 folders where is for the data and the notebook.

This model may can help:

1. Understand Market Trends: By predicting house prices, we can identify trends of price increases or decreases in specific regions. This information assists both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.
2. Financial Planning: Price predictions enable individuals and families to plan home purchases wisely. For instance, knowing the estimated future house prices aids in savings and financing planning.
3. Property Investment: For investors, predicting house prices helps in selecting potentially profitable properties. Understanding the factors influencing prices allows for smarter decision-making.
4. Housing Policies: Government and related institutions can use house price predictions to design effective and sustainable housing policies.

But note this model is overfitting so I not recomend to using it, and feel free to pull my code for improvement for this model.
